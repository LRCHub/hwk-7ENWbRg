We've been to places dark and wet
We promised never to forget

We've been to places hot and dry
And we were never satisfied

Please take me back to where we've been
And show me now what we have seen
And I will understand

We've been to lakes in the desert
We stood in the rain on the moon
We knew the door to the treasure
But we've never ever been
Inside the holy room

We have been standing in the cold
And it felt not as we've been told

We had the chance to change the past
We had the chance to make it last

All the places we have seen
They do not look like in our dreams
And I don't understand

We've been to lakes in the desert
We stood in the rain on the moon
We knew the door to the treasure
But we've never ever been
Inside the holy room
