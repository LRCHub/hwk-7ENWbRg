Line stood firm
Across the desert floor
In the eyes of a soldier
And his private law
Red hot the sun burns
Across the desert floor

*Got to fight some more*
*Got to fight some more*

Crash of thunder
Through the evening dust
Sheet light & smoulder
The desert lust
Laughing the souldier
He fights for us
Got to fight for us

Fighting for the sun
Fighting - for the sun

Shouts of glory
From the desert sand
Scream of the soldier
From another land
Red hot the sun burns
Across the desert floor

*Got to fight some more*
*Got to fight some more*

Fighting
Fighting
Fighting for the sun

Fighting
Fighting
For the sun
For the sun
For the sun

*Got to fight some more*
*Got to fight some more*
